This is a very simple application that you can use to visualize your lifts from the [strong app]([URL](https://www.strong.app/)).
Simply drag you strong.csv file into the main directory. This file can be exported from the settings on the strong app.
Then start the server by running 
```
python3 server.py
```
In a seperate terminal naviagate to the react folder and start the react app.
```
